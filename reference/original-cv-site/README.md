## Development

There is no build step, the site is hand coded.

- Clone the repo.
- Optionally install [Node](nodejs.org/), optionally install [Yarn](yarnpkg.com/).
- Make changes, including the package name and other details in `package.json`.
- `yarn` or `npm install` to install dev dependencies, `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to serve the site locally. Alternatively open index.html in your browser using the file protocol.
- Publish to a static site hosting solution.
