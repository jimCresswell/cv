              <p><a href="https://www.obaith.com">Obaith</a> is an early-stage tech for good startup exploring how digital services can support positive change on climate breakdown, biodiversity, and social connection, through networks of community projects.</p>
              <p>After several years of full-time research (what do these interrelated problems look like from a systems change perspective? What are the leverage points and scalable solutions? What's holding people back?), and network building, I am ready to step back and start the deliberately gradual process of prototyping the Obaith services as a side-project. As such I am now looking for other client-engagements and am available immediately for full-time work.</p>

                <h3>Programme QA Consultant</h3>
                <p>The Home Office</p>
                <p class="duration"><time datetime="2017-02">February 2017</time> to <time datetime="2017-12">December 2017</time> (11&nbsp;months)</p>
              </header>
              <p>I <b>led strategy creation and adoption</b> for improving software delivery processes and tooling, <b>with a focus on QA automation, across an agile programme (2 projects, 6 scrum teams)</b>. My achievements included human-readable automatically validated product specifications, and advancing the journey to continuous delivery for a micro-service architecture public facing digital service (Node + Java). Strategy and results were communicated in audience appropriate ways to technical, product and management stakeholders.</p>
              <p>I created several test automation frameworks (<b>JavaScript/Node and Java</b>) and many technical demos using industry standard technologies and tools (<b>Cucumber, WebDriver (Node and Java bindings), Selenium Grid, SauceLabs, Mocha, JUnit, REST Assured, Pact, git, GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Jira, Trello, Confluence, Slack, IntelliJ IDEA, Webstorm</b>).</p>
              <p>I <b>coordinated and communicated between architects, programme leads, analysts and QA and technical leads</b> to enable comprehensive automated validation and continuous rapid feedback. I advocated for business and user facing <a href="https://gojko.net/books/specification-by-example/">specification by example</a>, engineering facing micro-service testing, and the radical shifting left of validation and feedback timescales using <b>specification workshops, static code analysis, product and infrastructure-as-code unit tests (TDD), consumer-driven contract testing, GUI and API functional testing (BDD), blocking code merge on validation, and whole-of-product level (end-to-end) testing</b>.</p>

              <p>I co-created the business communication tool <a href="https://github.com/jimCresswell/specs">Specs</a> (<b>Node, NodeGit, HTML, CSS</b>) which increases visibility of user stories expressed using the Cucumber format to non-technical stakeholders, Cucumber allows business requirements to be automatically validated providing a solid metric for completeness of work, so reducing wasted effort, rework, and delays.</p>
              <p>I <b>drove awareness and adoption of software product delivery best practices and tools</b> among executive, design and development teams, through planning sessions and audience appropriate communication. I introduced the test automation team to <b>git, supporting services like GitHub and GitLab, and related workflows to enable more agile development. I prototyped testing approaches with Cucumber, WebDriver, and Appium (JavaScript and Java APIs) and SauceLabs</b>.</p>
              <p>I provided education and training for Specification by Example (building the right thing) and related <b>Test Driven Development and Behaviour Driven Development</b> approaches (building things right). I helped develop a long term strategy around continuous testing and continuous delivery including championing the adoption of cloud technologies.</p>

              <p>I joined <a href="http://labs.ft.com/">FT Labs</a> while it was still the startup Assanka, which was <a href="http://labs.ft.com/2012/01/strike-me-pink-assanka-and-the-ft/">bought by the Financial Times</a> and became the web technology R&amp;D group responsible for the development of the multi-award winning, cross-platform HTML5 and JavaScript <a href="http://app.ft.com">FT web app</a>.</p>
              <p><b>I contributed extensively to the FT web app code base in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and PHP</b>, using the FT Labs front-end MVC framework <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fruitmachine">Fruitmachine</a>, <b>Git, and GitHub</b>. This included requirement definition and analysis, feature development, testing, bug reporting and fixing, daily stand-ups, and sprint planning.</p>
              <p>I took the technical lead with design input on the delivery of the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-gb/app/c223c072-f26f-4e98-a444-74b287313dbd">FT Windows 8 app</a>. I liaised between FT product managers, FT designers, Microsoft executives, and Microsoft tech evangelists, and led communication, defined requirements, and scheduled development. I also drove the creation of an experimental FT FirefoxOS app.</p>
              <p>After 2 years I changed focus to <b>lead QA automation and strategy</b> for FT Labs, reporting to the directors. I introduced end-to-end testing using <b>WebDriver (Java) and Jenkins</b>, with a drive towards continuous integration and best practice; preventing development being blocked by broken code, and increasing delivery velocity. I created a test framework, encouraged developers to take responsibility for creating further tests, and <b>oversaw a team of testers</b>. I experimented with automated visual regression testing using the BBC's <a href="http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/">Wraith</a> framework.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am interested in applying whole-of-system analysis, design thinking, and theories of change to decentralised ecological, economic, and <a href="https://www.obaith.com">community networks</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mrintegralpermanence/">sustainable and regenerative agriculture</a>, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/william_mcdonough_on_cradle_to_cradle_design">cradle-to-cradle design</a>, and putting regenerative processes at the heart of the lived human experience.</p>
        <p>I ran as a councillor in the 2018 UK local elections with the party that came second in my ward. I would consider running again as an independent, on locally important issues, using lessons from <a href="https://www.flatpackdemocracy.co.uk/">Flatpack Democracy</a>. I volunteer at a community-run <a href="https://www.growingcommunities.org/volunteering-hackney">market garden</a> helping to bring <a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/">good food</a> to urban communities.</p>
        <p>I am interested in how knowledge can be efficiently derived from data and communicated in meaningful ways. I created a <a href="http://jimcresswell.net/world-bank-graphing-demo/">data visualisation app</a> for some <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank metrics on development</a>. I created a <a href="http://jimcresswell.net/triple-t/">tic-tac-toe game</a> (<b>JavaScript, React</b>) including an <b>opponent AI algorithm</b> that is difficult, but not impossible, to beat.</p>
