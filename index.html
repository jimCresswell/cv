        <p>I am a strategy focussed creative technologist with a background in software and science. I offer consultancy on software product delivery and quality improvements through human communication and extensive appropriate automated checks.</p>
        <p>I have driven process and tooling decisions on projects from product, engineering, and business perspectives, helping organisations improve whole-of-lifecycle efficiency to deliver the right products, on time.</p>
        <p>I am a <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Cresswell%2C+J+G">published scientist</a> experienced in using a systems perspective and data to inform understanding and strategic direction.</p>

                <h3>Programme QA Consultant</h3>
                <p>The Home Office</p>
                <p class="duration"><time datetime="2017-02">February 2017</time> to <time datetime="2017-12">December 2017</time> (11&nbsp;months)</p>

              <p>I led strategy creation and engagement, for improving software delivery processes and tooling; focussing on meaningful, automatically validatable specifications, and the journey to continuous delivery for a microservice architecture, public facing digital service.</p>
              <p>I worked directly with architects, programme leads, analysts and QA and technical leads in six agile teams to advise on high level strategy and patterns, and low level implementation approaches for comprehensive automated validation and rapid feedback. I advocated for business and user facing <a href="https://gojko.net/books/specification-by-example/">specification by example</a>, engineering facing micoservice testing, and the radical shifting left of validation and feedback timescales using specification workshops, static code analysis, product and infrastructure-as-code unit tests, contract testing, GUI and API functional testing, blocking code merge on validation, and the responsible minimum of whole-of-product level testing.</p>

                <h3>QA Automation Consultant</h3>
                <p>British Airways</p>
                <p class="duration"><time datetime="2015-03">March 2015</time> to <time datetime="2015-12">December 2015</time> (10&nbsp;months)</p>
              </header>
              <p>I co-created a business communication tool <a href="https://github.com/jimCresswell/specs">Specs</a> (Node, NodeGit, HTML5 etc) which increases visibility of user stories expressed using the Cucumber format to non-technical stakeholders, Cucumber allows business requirements to be automatically validated providing a solid metric for completeness of work, so reducing wasted effort, rework and delays.</p>
              <p>I drove awareness and adoption of software product delivery best practices and tools among executive, design and development teams, through planning sessions and audience appropriate communication. I introduced the test automation team to Git, supporting services like GitHub and GitLab and related workflows to enable more agile development. I also prototyped testing approaches with Cucumber, WebDriver and Appium using JavaScript and Java APIs.</p>
              <p>I provided education and training for Specification by Example (building the right thing) and related Test Driven Development and Behaviour Driven Development approaches (building things right). I also helped develop a long term strategy around continuous testing and continuous delivery including championing the adoption of cloud technologies.</p>

                <h3>Labs Developer</h3>
                <p>FT Labs (Financial Times)</p>
                <p class="duration"><time datetime="2011-08">August 2011</time> to <time datetime="2014-07">July 2014</time> (3&nbsp;years)</p>
              </header>
              <p>I joined <a href="http://labs.ft.com/">FT Labs</a> while it was still the startup Assanka which was <a href="http://labs.ft.com/2012/01/strike-me-pink-assanka-and-the-ft/">bought by the Financial Times</a> and became the web technology R&amp;D group responsible for the development of the multi-award winning, cross-platform HTML5 and JavaScript <a href="http://app.ft.com">FT web app</a>.</p>
              <p>I contributed extensively to the FT web app code base focussing on JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and using the FT Labs front-end MVC framework <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fruitmachine">Fruitmachine</a>, with exposure to back-end PHP and Node.js, also using Git and Github. This included requirement definition and analysis, feature development, testing, bug reporting and fixing, daily stand-ups and sprint planning.</p>
              <p>About 6 months in I took the technical lead with design input on the delivery of the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-gb/app/c223c072-f26f-4e98-a444-74b287313dbd">FT Windows 8 app</a>. I liaised between FT product managers, FT designers, Microsoft executives and Microsoft tech evangelists, drove communication, defined requirements and scheduled development. I also drove the creation of an experimental FT FirefoxOS app.</p>
              <p>After 2 years I changed focus to lead QA automation and strategy for FT Labs, reporting weekly to the directors. I introduced end-to-end testing using WebDriver, Jenkins and Java with a focus on continuous integration and best practice, with the goal of development never being blocked by broken code. I architected a test suite, implemented by myself and a team of 1-3 testers, and encouraged developers to take responsibility for creating further tests. I also experimented with automated visual regression testing using the BBCs <a href="http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/">Wraith</a> framework.</p>

The work was largely carried out in C and Matlab with some SQL.</p>
              <p>I used data from the <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a> citizen science project to challenge the then conventional assumptions about the relationship between galaxy shape and colour.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am interested in applying whole-of-system analysis, design thinking and theories of change to decentralised ecological, economic and <a href="https://www.obaith.com">community networks</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mrintegralpermanence/">sustainable and regenerative agriculture</a>, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/william_mcdonough_on_cradle_to_cradle_design">cradle-to-cradle design</a>, and putting regenerative processes at the heart of the lived human experience.</p>
        <p>I ran in the 2018 UK local elections and came second in my ward, if I run again it will be on an independent platform focussed on locally important issues using lessons from <a href="https://www.flatpackdemocracy.co.uk/">Flatpack Democracy</a>. I volunteer at a community run <a href="https://www.growingcommunities.org/volunteering-hackney">market garden</a> helping to bring <a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/">good food</a> to urban communities.</p>
        <p>I am interested in how knowledge can be efficiently derived from data and communicated, I created a <a href="http://jimcresswell.net/world-bank-graphing-demo/">data visualisation app</a> for some <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank metrics on development</a>. I also created a tic-tac-toe game with a difficult but not impossible to beat <a href="http://jimcresswell.net/triple-t/">opponent AI</a>.</p>
