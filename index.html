                <h3>Programme QA Consultant</h3>
                <p>The Home Office (part-remote)</p>
                <p class="duration"><time datetime="2017-02">February 2017</time> to <time datetime="2017-12">December 2017</time> (11&nbsp;months)</p>
              </header>
              <p>I led QA automation strategy creation and adoption (including hands-on development) across an agile programme of 2 projects and 6 scrum teams creating a micro-service architecture public facing web service (Node + Java). My achievements included human-readable, automatically validated product specifications through coaching teams in BDD scenario/test case writing using Cucumber (and JavaScript, Java, Webdriver, Jenkins), creating working examples of new automated test approaches with a variety of technologies, and massively speeding up feedback from automated testing (shifting validation left, and faster and more stable UI tests). Strategy and results were communicated in audience appropriate ways to technical, product and management stakeholders through presentations, personal coaching, Slack and Confluence.</p>
              <p>I created several test automation frameworks (<b>JavaScript/Node and Java</b>) from scratch, and many technical demos using industry standard technologies and tools (<b>Cucumber, Selenium (Node and Java bindings), Selenium Grid, SauceLabs, Mocha, JUnit, REST Assured, Pact, git, GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Jira, Confluence, Slack, IntelliJ IDEA, Webstorm</b>).</p>
              <p>I <b>coordinated and communicated between architects, programme leads, analysts and QA and technical leads</b> to enable comprehensive automated validation and continuous rapid feedback. I advocated for business and user facing <a href="https://gojko.net/books/specification-by-example/">specification by example</a> (supporting BDD), engineering facing micro-service testing (creating and improving test cases, advocating TDD), and the radical shifting left of validation and feedback timescales using <b>specification workshops, static code analysis, product and infrastructure-as-code unit tests (TDD), consumer-driven contract testing, GUI and API functional testing (BDD), blocking code merge on validation, testing micro-services in isolation, and whole-of-product level (end-to-end) testing</b>. I advocated for accessibility, performance and security testing becoming an automatic part of the release process</p>

              <p>I provided education and training for Specification by Example (building the right thing, <b>BDD</b>), and unit and integration testing approaches (building things right, <b>TDD</b>). I developed and advocated a long term strategy around continuous testing and continuous delivery, including championing the adoption of cloud technologies and supporting an incremental migration to a micro-services architecture. I supported shifting testing left, increasing the speed and stability of the UI tests, and improving reporting (and attention paid to) results in CI (Jenkins).</p>
              <p>I <b>drove awareness and adoption of software product delivery best practices and tools</b> among executive, design and development teams, through planning sessions, presentations and digital communication. I introduced the test automation team (agile, scrum) to <b>git, GitHub, GitLab, and git supported agile development, leading the migration from SVN. I created test frameworks with Cucumber, Selenium WebDriver (JavaScript and Java APIs), Appium, Sauce Labs, Jenkins, and Jira</b>.</p>
              <p>I co-created the business communication tool <a href="https://github.com/jimCresswell/specs">Specs</a> (<b>Node, NodeGit, HTML, CSS</b>) designed to make product specifications written with Gherkin/Cucumber visible to non-technical stakeholders.</p>

              <p>I joined <a href="http://labs.ft.com/">FT Labs</a> while it was still the startup Assanka, which was <a href="http://labs.ft.com/2012/01/strike-me-pink-assanka-and-the-ft/">bought by the Financial Times</a> and became the web technology R&amp;D group responsible for the development of the multi-award winning, cross-platform HTML5 and JavaScript <a href="http://app.ft.com">FT web app</a>.</p>
              <p><b>As a web developer I contributed extensively to the FT web app code base in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and PHP</b>, using the FT Labs front-end MVC framework <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fruitmachine">Fruitmachine</a> (the big frameworks weren't around yet), <b>git, and GitHub</b>. This included requirement definition and analysis, feature development, testing, bug reporting and fixing, daily stand-ups, and sprint planning.</p>
              <p>I took the technical lead on the delivery of the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-gb/app/c223c072-f26f-4e98-a444-74b287313dbd">FT Windows 8 app</a>, liaising with FT product managers, FT designers, Microsoft executives, and Microsoft tech evangelists. I led communication, defined requirements, and scheduled development. I also drove the creation of an experimental FT FirefoxOS app.</p>
              <p>After 2 years I changed focus to <b>lead QA automation and strategy</b> for FT Labs, reporting to the directors. I introduced end-to-end testing using <b>WebDriver (Java) and Jenkins</b>, with a drive towards continuous integration and best practice; preventing development being blocked by broken code, and increasing delivery velocity. I created a test framework, encouraged developers to take responsibility for creating further tests (end-to-end, integration, unit), and <b>oversaw a team of testers</b>. I experimented with automated visual regression testing using the BBC's <a href="http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/">Wraith</a> framework.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am interested in putting regenerative process at the heart of every day life by applying whole-of-system thinking and theories of change to <a href="https://www.reforest-now.uk/">ecological solutions to global problems</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211114073948/https://www.obaith.com/">community networks</a>, and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/william_mcdonough_on_cradle_to_cradle_design">cradle-to-cradle design</a>.</p>
        <p>I ran as a councillor in the 2018 UK local elections with the party that came second in my ward. I would consider running again as an independent, on locally important issues, using lessons from <a href="https://www.flatpackdemocracy.co.uk/">Flatpack Democracy</a>. I volunteer at a community-run <a href="https://www.growingcommunities.org/volunteering-hackney">market garden</a> helping to bring <a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/">good food</a> to urban communities.</p>
        <p>I am interested in how knowledge can be efficiently derived from data and communicated in meaningful and audience appropriate ways. I created a <a href="http://jimcresswell.net/world-bank-graphing-demo/">data visualisation app</a> for some <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank metrics on development</a>. I created a <a href="http://jimcresswell.net/triple-t/">tic-tac-toe game</a> (<b>JavaScript, React</b>) including an <b>opponent AI algorithm</b> that is difficult, but not impossible, to beat.</p>
