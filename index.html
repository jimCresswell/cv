              <p>I created a business communication tool <a href="https://github.com/jimCresswell/specs">Specs</a> which increases visibility of user stories expressed using the Cucumber format to non-technical stakeholders, Cucumber allows business requirements to be automatically validated providing a solid metric for completeness of work.</p>
              <p>I drove awareness and adoption of industry best practices and tools among executive, design and development teams through targetted communication.</p>
              <p>These included tools such as Git, GitHub, GitLab, the Gitflow workflow.</p>
              <p><a href="https://books.gojko.net/specification-by-example/">Specification by Example</a> (building the right thing) and related Behaviour Driven Development approaches, focussing on early discussion of requirements to avoid costly rework and delays.</p>
              <p>Strategy around continuous testing and continuous delivery including champioing adoption of cloud technologies.</p>

                <h3>Labs Developer</h3>
                <p>FT Labs</p>
                <p class="duration"><time datetime="2011-08">August 2011</time> to <time datetime="2014-07">July 2014</time> (3&nbsp;years)</p>

              <p>UX and design input and two products, Windows and FFOS</p>
              <p>I joined <a href="http://labs.ft.com/">FT Labs</a> while it was still the startup Assanka which was <a href="http://labs.ft.com/2012/01/strike-me-pink-assanka-and-the-ft/">bought by the Financial Times</a> and became the web technology R&amp;D group responsible for the development of the multi-award winning, cross-platform HTML5 and JavaScript <a href="http://app.ft.com">FT web app</a>.</p>
              <p>I contributed extensively to the FT web app code base focussing on JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and using the FT Labs front-end MVC framework <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fruitmachine">Fruitmachine</a>, with exposure to back-end PHP and Node.js, also using Git and Github. This included requirement definition and analysis, feature development, testing, bug reporting and fixing, daily standups and contributing to sprint planning.</p>
              <p>About 6 months in I took the technical lead with design input on the delivery of the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-gb/app/c223c072-f26f-4e98-a444-74b287313dbd">FT Windows app</a>. I liaised between FT product managers, FT designers, Microsoft executives and Microsoft tech evangelists, drove communication, defined requirements and scheduled development. I drove the creation of an experimental FT FirefoxOS app.</p>
              <p>After 2 years I changed focus to lead QA automation and strategy for FT Labs, reporting weekly to the directors. I introduced functional testing using WebDriver, Jenkins and Java with a focus on continuous integration, best practice and striving for the main branch to never be broken. I architected a test suite implemented by myself and a team of 1-3 testers and encourage developers to take responsibility for creating further tests. I experimented with automated visual regression testing using the BBCs <a href="https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith">Wraith</a>. During this time I also drove the development of the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/ft-web-app">FT Firefox OS app</a> and throughout continued working on the FT web app code base.</p>

              <p>I planned and carried out research at the world class <a href="http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/">Institute for Cosmology and Gravitation</a> into data modelling applied to large astrophysical datasets, requiring parameter fitting and data visualisation, largely carried out in C and Matlab with some SQL.</p>
              <p>I used data from the <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a> citizen science project to challenge the conventional assumptions of the relationship between galaxy shape as measured by a hundred and fifty thousand citizen science volunteers on the web, and galaxy colour - as measured by the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>.</p>
              <p>I designed my publications, including my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7UZZxXkVSS2UW5ucVRUMkpOVG8/view?usp=sharing">thesis</a>, with the document markup language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX"><span class="latex">L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</span></a>.</p>

              <p>I was hired to carry out manual test plan design and execution for a HP storage product (D2D) software and hardware. A colleague and I quickly evolved that into a team effort to create a set of test automation scripts which became a Perl based test automation harness and test suite, which further evolved into a sanctioned test automation tool still used internally by multiple HP Labs sites.</p>
