# The CV of Jim Cresswell

This project aims to rewrite Jim Cresswell's CV using modern web technologies: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It will use new content provided in `reference/new_cv_content.json`.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to create a new, dynamic, and maintainable CV website based on the provided content and design principles potentially derived from the original site.

## Original Site Context

The previous version of the CV exists in the `reference/original-site` directory. Key characteristics of the original site include:

- **Technology:** Static website built with plain HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript (primarily for easter eggs).
- **Structure:** Semantically structured HTML (header, contact, employment, education, interests, footer).
- **Styling:** Basic CSS for layout (single column, centred, max-width) and typography. Included separate print-specific styles (`print.css`) which adjusted layout, fonts, and visibility for printing (e.g., hiding screen-only elements, showing print-only elements).
- **Content:** The original content is present in `reference/original_cv_content.json` and embedded directly in the HTML.
